# Sentient Sims App

The Sentient Sims app is an app that runs while you play the Sentient Sims mod.

The application is needed to be able to talk to the Open AI API securely. The Sims 4 developers
did not include the necessary code to be able to securely send requests, which is needed to
talk to the internet. If you dont have this, the communication is sent in plain text and anyone
can intercept your data and read it.
